# Dictionary Comprehension in Python

Python dictionary comprehension is a concise way to construct dictionaries in a single line of code. You can create dictionaries from iterable objects such as lists.

## Syntax
```python
{key_expression: value_expression for item in iterable}
```

### Condition in Dictionary Comprehension
You can customize dictionary comprehensions by adding conditions to each iteration.

```python
# Using dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary of squared even numbers
numbers = {x: x**2 for x in range(1, 11) if x % 2 == 0}
print(numbers)
# Output: {2: 4, 4: 16, 6: 36, 8: 64, 10: 100}
```

### Creating a Dictionary from Lists
You can create a dictionary from existing lists, using one list for keys and another for values.

```python
keys = ['a', 'b', 'c']
values = [1, 2, 3]
result = {k: v for k, v in zip(keys, values)}
print(result)
# Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```

### Nested Dictionary Comprehension
You can nest dictionary comprehensions to create nested dictionaries.

```python
dictionary = {
    k1: {k2: k1 * k2 for k2 in range(2, 6)} for k1 in range(5, 7)
}
print(dictionary)
# Output: {5: {2: 10, 3: 15, 4: 20, 5: 25}, 6: {2: 12, 3: 18, 4: 24, 5: 30}}
```

## Challenge: Find Common Elements in Multiple Lists

```python
# Problem Statement - Find Common Elements from the given multiple Lists.
def find_common_elements(lists):
    common_elements = {element: min(lst.count(element) for lst in lists) for element in set.intersection(*map(set, lists))}
    return common_elements

list1 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]
list2 = [2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
list3 = [3, 4, 5, 5, 6]

result = find_common_elements([list1, list2, list3])

for element, frequency in result.items():
    print(f"Element: {element}, Frequency: {frequency}")
# Output: Element: 3, Frequency: 1
#         Element: 4, Frequency: 1
```
